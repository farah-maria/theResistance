**In a galaxy far far away...**

**Grogu wants eggs, and you're his only hope!!**

<br>

The child, Grogu, is aboard a ship with the Frog Lady and her jar of delicious eggs. He's not meant to eat them, but they taste so good!

Can you grab as many eggs as you can from the jar, when the Frog lady isn't looking?
Be careful, or she'll catch you!
If you're really smart, you might even get to see your elusive protector, the Mandalorian.
But he's not keen on you eating those eggs, either, so that's double trouble!
